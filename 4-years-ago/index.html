      <p class="explanation">
        “An inactive checkbox is always a bit of a mystery to me. Why is it inactive? How do I get it to activate so I can select it?”

      <h1 class="title">Be a better designer by designing less</h1>
      <p class="explanation">
        “It’s common for designers to rely on inspiration sources. For many, that process is never really fleshed out. They find something that inspires them, then they work incredibly hard to create something original. Most struggle.”

      <p class="explanation">
        “So from a user perspective, mobile apps will likely disappear completely. Or to such an extent they’re barely even noticeable.”

        “Yes, VR is immersive and you can design 360 degrees. But take into consideration the likelihood of the user doing so. Or at least their comfort. Designing behind the user is “below the fold” on steroids.”
